<h2 align="center">Cleaning up the data</h2>

---

In order to more efficiently use our data, we started by cleaning up the dataset.

## üí° Idea

In order to get better data, and better results on our testing, we decided to consider both the training and the testing dataset when we were calculating averages as well as minimums an maximums.

After doing this process, we noticed a considerable accuracy boost.
