<h2 align="center">Cleaning up the data</h2>

---

In order to more efficiently use our data, we started by cleaning up the dataset.

## üí° Idea

In order to get better data, and better results on our testing, we decided to consider both the training and the testing dataset when we were calculating averages as well as minimums an maximums.

After doing this process, we noticed a considerable accuracy boost.

## üåê Adding features with the second dataset

The more relevant features we have, the better it is, that is why we have used the data set "consumeractions" which gives relevant information about the engagement rate of each user toward the brands of P&G, and the level of interest of these users. We used this data set to add new features to our user's rows :
'interested_by_fairypeps_email' : says if a user has had actions related to an email about FAIRY PEPS
'level_of_interest_about_marketing' : a continuous value between 0-1 depending on whether the user has just opened an email or has gone further by clicking or using coupons.
'number_of_actions' : counter of the actions of the user related to emails, coupons or search bar of the website
